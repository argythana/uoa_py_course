## Course Material: (Under extensive refactoring, given the feedback from the class of 2024).

Two kinds of material are provided:  
1. "Guides" with instructions to install, set up, and/or use various tools.  
Some tools are about python, some are on how to use the PC.  
2. Python content.

Both kinds of material is explained in the lectures and should be studied.

### Section 1: Basic python for Data Science
See lectures 1 to 5.  
The goal of this section is to learn some of the very basics of python.
Focus on how the basic concepts are used in data science, machine learning, and AI.

### Section 2: Working with Data and Dataframes
See lecture 6.  
Add in lecture 6, feedback from class of 2024:  
Discuss more about "changes" in dataframes, drop columns, add columns, mutable, not mutable, best practices, etc.

Feedback from class of 2024: Add lecture 7 here for data preprocessing (nan, encoding, scaling, convert incorrect types).
**Reminder for next year**: utilise the numpy 2.0 release changes to emphasize version control.
Until now, such topics are covered a) as complementary material, scattered and fragmented in small parts in each ML algo lecture.
b) after teaching the algos within the material about "pipelines" and "Grid search", parameter tuning.

### Topic 3: EDA, Static and Interactive Visualisations
See lecture 7. Todo: Refactor to lecture 8.

### Topic 4: Machine Learning Algos
See lectures 8-12. To be refactored as 9 to 13.
9: Regession: Linear, Logistic
10: Clustering: K-means.
11: Classification: All Algos in one lecture (Logistic, Kmeans, Naive Bayes, SVM)
12 (Todo: add for 2025): Ensemble methods, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.

### Section 5: Deep Learning and AI (NNs, Computer Vision, LLMs)
Lectures 13-16. Requires a lot of refactoring and thought.
Suggestions from class of 2024:
13: Neural Networks, Keras, TensorFlow, LSTMs
14: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Image Processing
15: Pytorch Locally
16: Pytorch on the cloud, Google Colab, Kaggle, etc.

### Extra: Python in the workplace by UoA - BIS graduates.
"Experimental". Extra, optional presentations, started in 2024, scheduled for June 2024.  
Example A: Data management and reporting worklow in a betting company.  (Pending)
Example B: Auditing Cybersecurity Documents with a fine-tuned LLM.  (DONE)
Example C: Administrative work tasks at a University. (Generate mass word documents, pdfs, and emails).  (Pending)
