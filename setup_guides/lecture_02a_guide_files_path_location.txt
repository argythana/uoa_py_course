BIS UOA course
author: Argyriou Thanasis
Lecture 2, instructions, Path and Files location.

Todo, refactor for 2025:
Todo: The last two sections of this should be a separate file.
Todo: Explain CLI commands extensively before Venvs in lecture 3.
Todo: Combine windows CLI with linux CLI commands that can be used in ipynbs.

MANAGE FILES LOCATION:
----------------------

	Next thing to learn:
	a) "working directory",
	b) "Path".
	c) "Absolute Path"
	d) "Relative Path"

	Read the wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)
	Read carefully the section: "Absolute and relative paths"

	If you installed python properly:
	Python is able to start its interpreter and is also able to "run" .py files from any location in the PC.
	
	Definitions:
	- "Path": is a series of characters to indentify a unique "location" in a PC.
	  Simply, "path" is the path to open a saved file.
	- In programming the "path" is a necessary part of the name of a file.
	  You may "reference" a file from anywhere if you use its path.
	- "Directory": type of catalogue that contains a list of files and other catalogues.
	  The common name is "folder".
	
	----------------------------------------------------
	Examples on running python from different locations:
	
	i) Open python interpreter or IDLE from the "start menu".
	In the python interpreter type the following and press enter at end of each line:
	>>>import os
	>>>os.getcwd()
		
	In Windows the output is: 'C:\\Users\\tharg\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311'
	
	This is the *path* to the location in which python is installed.
	This is the default path from which Windows runs Python.
	All python installed files are insside the directory "Python310".
	You may also navigate there using the mouse and the graphics to see what's in there.
	
	KEY thing to remember:
	DO NOT SAVE FILES IN THIS LOCATION (in the folder in which python is installed).
	
	* "os" is a python built-in module, don't worry about this for now.
	os.getcwd() is a command to show the "Current Working Directory".
	
	
	ii) Open python interpreter or IDLE from Command Line.
	Type the following and press enter at end of each line:
	>>>import os
	>>>os.getcwd()
	In Windows the output is:
	'C:\Users\your_windows_user_name>'
	
	
	iii) Open python IDLE from any folder you want.
	Open any folder with the mouse and click inside the path bar.
	Type "cmd" and press enter.
	The Windows terminal will open and you may run python.
	
	Remember: python is run in different directory in each case.
	
	
	--------------------------------------------
	Basic Windows commands that you should know.
	--------------------------------------------
	
	a) "dir" => list the files and folders in current directory (from the word directory).
	* the equivalent command in Mac and in Linux is "ls"  (from the word list).
	
	b) "cd" => change directory (the same in in Mac and in Linux)
	
	Examples and practice:
	Open a Windows terminal.
	Type "dir" and presss "enter". (Without quotes).
	Chose a folder you want to go into. eg: "uoa_py_course".
	Type "cd uoa_py_course" and press Enter. You have moved to:
	
	C:\Users\tharg\uoa_py_course>     (tharg is me, NOT you!)
	
	"cd .." => go "up" one folder.
	C:\Users\tharg>
	
	"cd uoa_py_course\lectures" => you change directory to two folders "down".
	"cd ..\.." => you change directory and move two folders "up".	
	

	--------------------------------------------
	Move from terminal to graphical interface windows and back.
	--------------------------------------------

	If you type "cmd" in any window's search bar, it will open the terminal in that path.

	If you type "start." in the terminal, it will open a window in that path.

	If you type "start" in the terminal, it will open another terminal in that path.

	Advanced Hackers tip: Did you know that there are "wildcards" in programming?
	Read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character

	Using the commang line, try the command:
	"dir *.py"
	or go to a directory with many word fires and try:
	"dir *.doc*"
