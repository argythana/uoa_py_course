# Optional advanced practice exrcise:

---  
**Replicate some of the examples in the two lecture files using the `polars` package.**   
---  

If you don't feel confident to start on YOUR OWN and find EVERYTHING about using POLARS, you  have 2 options:
a) don't try this exercise,
b) even better, just use an AI coding assistant (recommended option).

Hint: The goal of the exercise, is to encourage you to start using AI as much as possible, not just ot try out polars, which is great of course.

Instructions:

Create two new .ipynb files.

Name the files `practice_lec_06_polars_index.ipynb` and `practice_lec_06_polars_methods.ipynb`.

You may do this on the same dataset or select any other dataset you prefer.

Extra advanced: do the same using the `pySpark` package. You may try the `Koalas` package as well.
Of course, use an AI.
