# Replicate some of the examples in the two lecture files using the `polars` package.  

Create two new .ipynb files.
Name them `practice_lec_06_polars_index.ipynb` and `practice_lec_06_polars_methods.ipynb`.

You may do this on the same data or select any other dataset you prefer.

Extra advanced: do the same using the `pySpark` package. You may try the `Koalas` package as well.
