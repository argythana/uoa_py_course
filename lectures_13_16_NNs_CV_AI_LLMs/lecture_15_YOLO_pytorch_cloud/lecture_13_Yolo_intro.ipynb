    "2. The module versions that are installed are not pinned. The notebook will probably not run next week! You need to pin the versions of the libraries.\n",
    "3. Create a roboflow account and copy your **Private** API key to the notebook (takes 1 minute). Don't share the API key.\n",
    "4. First show which directories are created in Colab and how to navigate them.\n",
    "5. Download only the nano and small version of the model weights. Demonstrate the difference in ram, speed and accuracy.\n",
