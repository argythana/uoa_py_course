Lecture 1, instructions, part C, Simple script.

-------------------------
CREATE, RUN, EDIT py SCRIPT:
-------------------------

	Third thing to learn: Create a script, save, run, edit it.

	--------------
    Important Note: To "run" a script and to open a script file in order to "edit" is not the same thing.
    ---------------

    Important Note:
    ---------------
	If you double-click on a .py file of this lecture: 
	It will not open for "editing". Python will "run" it.
	So, in this case you will see nothing.
    -----------------------------------------------------

	
	1) First contact, be brave!
	
	Open the IDLE.
	Type what you see after >>> and press enter.
	
	>>> foo = 4
	>>> foo
	4
	
	You created an "object" with "name" (foo) and "assigned" a "value" to it (4).
	Every time you "call" this variable by its "name",
	python will "return" its "value".
	
	Please remember the concepts:
	"object", "name", "assign", "value", "call", "return".
	
	MY UGLY ROMANTIC POEM ABOUT PYTHON.
	(Read it slowly like a poem, twice)
	------
	In python everything that we create is an "object",
	We give it a "name",
	we "call" it by its "name",
	We "assign" a "value" to it (and attributes and methods too).
	So, when we "call" an "object" by its "name", e.g "foo",
	python "returns" to us its "value".
	After some lectures, this ugly poem will make sense to you.
	------ (end of ugly poem)

	ASSIGNMENT:
	This is the official explanation, definition of "assignment":
	"Assignment" statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to
    modify attributes or items of mutable objects.

	Which is better?

	
	2) First file.
	
	From the IDLE menu click "File" then "New File".
	Now you may work "non-interactively" and write thousands lines of code.
	Just enter the same as above:
	
	foo = 4
	foo
	
	Select "Run" from the editor menu and save it.
	(Save in a folder you have made for this course)
	There is no output in the IDLE interpreter window, by design.
	
	To have a value shown to us we need a special "function" called print().
	In the editor write:
	
	foo = 4
	print(foo)
	
	Save and select "Run".
	
	WoW, we just created a small script.
	It prints a value in the window of the interpeter.
	A small step for us, an even smaller step for humanity.
	
	To "run" a py file from windows command line:
	> python file_name.py
	(make sure to be in the same directory, or to give the correct path).
	
	----------------------------------------
	
	How to "EDIT" a saved python file:
	
	i) open IDLE menu "File" -> "Open" and select the file.
	or:
	ii) from a graphics window: right click and select "edit with IDLE".
