----------------------------------------
OPEN the PYTHON "INTERPRETER" and "IDLE"
----------------------------------------

	Second thing to learn: python "interpreter" and python "IDLE".
	For the first lectures we will work with the IDLE.

	Preliminary Definitions:
	------------------------
	a) "Command Line Interface (CLI)", "Terminal", "Console", "Shell", "Γραμμή εντολών".
	For the purpose of this course all these mean the same.
	Note: The PC Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux) has its own "terminal".  
        Python has a different kind of "terminal".
	
	b) "python interpreter"
	Documentation, please read:
	https://docs.python.org/3.9/tutorial/interpreter.html
	
    Simplistic explantation:
	We talk to the "interpeter" using a programming language (called Python).
	The "interpreter":
    translates python to computer language,
    communicates with the Computer and,
    replies back to us in human language.
    
    But, only if we use the right words. "Please" does not work, "sorry" neither.
	
	Keyword to remember: the "interpeter" works INTERACTIVELY (use for testing, debugging, to find errors)
	
	c) "python IDLE"
	IDLE is Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment.
    Simply: a (simple) python editor.
	The distinctive feature is: we can edit a script NON-INTERACTIVELY.
	
	IDLE also has an interactive interpreter window,
	but the IDLE non-interactive editor window is where most of the fun is.

	Using the IDLE you may work either "interactively", or "non-interactively".
	
	Documentation, please read it to get an idea:

=============================================================================
	
	A) How to open the python "interpreter":
	You open a dark door, don't have any fear of the dark.
    
	i) Using "Start Menu" key:
		a) press the "Windows" key also known as "Start Menu" key,
		b) type "python" and press "Enter". (check version)
		Now, you have entered the python interpreter terminal if you see
		the first line with the python version and then the python "prompt":
		
		>>> _
	
	OR
	ii) Using the Windows Command Line:
	You need to open a dark door with the label "Windows" on it,
	then a second dark door with the label "python". NO FEAR.
    
	First open Windows CLI:
		a) press "Windows key" + "R",
		b) type the word "cmd", press Enter,
		You are in the Windows Command Line if you see:
		the first line with the Windows version and the Windows prompt.
		C:\Users\your_windows_user_name>_
		
	Now open the python interpreter command line:
		c) type "python" or "py" and press "Enter".
		You 're in the python interpreter terminal if you see:
		the first line with the python version, some initial info and the "prompt":
		>>> _

	* On Windows, if you have installed different versions you can run then  
	  from the CLI using the "py -version.number" argument:
	  "py -3.9"
	  
		e.g.
		C:\Users\tharg>py -3.9
		C:\Users\tharg>py -3.10
		
		* On Mac, the keyboard shortcut to the CLI is: "command" key + "space".
	
=============================================================================

	B) How to open the python IDLE:
    
    i) From the "Start Menu":
		a) press "start Menu" key,
		b) type "idle" and press "Enter".
	
	Oh, we see some briht light now!
	You have opened the IDLE GUI (Graphical User Interface). Yes, it has amazing graphics.
		
	ii) From the Windows Command Line:
    	a) press "Windows key" + "R",
    	b) type "cmd", press Enter,
    	c) in the command prompt type "python -m idlelib" (without quotes) and press "Enter".
		
		* On Mac, the keyboard shortcut to the CLI is: "command" key + "space".
