    "A) Create a [Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) for project reproducability, resolve conflicting dependencies, mainting purposes.  \n",
    "We will use a package called `venv`: Virtual Environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "B) Install [modules in it](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) (only in it) or [install packages in it.](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#id13)   \n",
    "We will use a package called `pip`: Python Install Package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you tell the difference between modules and packages? Read the top two answers [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948494/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: install packages and modules ONLY from trusted sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "C) Run a jupyter notebook from your PC.  \n",
    "We will use a package called `jupyterlab` (ju-PY-ter NOT ju-PI-ter).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Make sure Python is included in Windows PATH (when installing).  \n",
    "Else: modify the installation from control panel (add or remove programs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Open \"Console\", aka \"Command Line Interface\" (CLI), aka \"Terminal, aka \"Shell\".  \n",
    "I will refer to it as **CLI**.    \n",
    "    For Windows:  \n",
    "\ta) press \"Windows key\" + \"R\"  \n",
    "\tb) type the word \"cmd\", press Enter\n",

    "You should now be inside the **Operating System** terminal in **your user** default path:  \n",

    "\n",
    "*For ALL the following commands, if python CLI command does not work in Windows shell:\t \n",
    "replace \"python\" with \"py\" (py is the Windows Python launcher).* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Check python and pip version.  \n",
    "Inside the CLI, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python --version```  (output should be like: 3.9.1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python -m pip --version```   (Check pip version and if pip is installed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the version number and the location (aka path) where the pip package is located by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar way to see the pip version is:  \n",
    "```pip --version```  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure you are at your Windows Command line, which has a single > (or the \\$ sign in MacOS) at the end,\n",
    "not at pythonâ€™s command prompt (python command line has three >>> instead)**"
