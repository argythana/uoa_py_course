# Welcome to the *"Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"* Course.  
This repo contains the lectures' material for the [Business Information Systems](https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/) Postgraduate Program.  

Administrative, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions, announcements) and any internal communication will be done via the e-class of the course.   

The course has been created, is being maintained and taught by [Thanasis Argyriou, @linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanasis-argyriou-06155a94/).

## Course Philosophy (WIP)

### A lot of good news for you!
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go beyond the basics in several advanced topics.
* You can't learn a foreign language (or coding) in five months, but you can learn enough to be able to advace on your own. 
* I promise you will be surprised by how much you can learn in a short period of time.
* Mid-course assignments and practice exercises are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit).
* Two types of practice exercises: "beginners" and "intermediate". Only "intermediate" practice exercises will be given feedback.
* Students grades are secondary here. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy it.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "almost mandatory". Learn to use them effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
* No exams, a [final assignment](https://github.com/argythana/uoa_py_course/tree/main/final_assignment), on a different dataset, domain for each student.
* The final assigment topic is generic, the data to work on is chosen by you. 

### A few not so good news...
* You have to study and practice a minimum of two hours after each lecture.
* Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times. If you didn't get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am mainly accountable for it.   
But, there is a limit to this. I can't think of a good joke about it yet, just an [anecdotal Sun Tzu story](https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/).   
The moral of the story above does not apply in business nor in education, so I would kindly ask you to assume responsibility for your learning. 
* All material is available online, but you cannot learn at your own pace. Attendance is mandatory.

## About the course structure and pace.
* The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one.
* If you skip a lecture, you will miss important insights, and you should definitely catch up before the next one.
* Good understanding of each lecture is a necessary prerequisite for the next one.   
* We cover the basics in each topic during class and there is some necessary reading before the next lecture.
* Please take a note of that: Reading the material before the next lecture is necessary.
* Each lecture starts with a short recap and some questions about the previous one.
* Besides the reading material, there is also some extra "optional, advanced" material in all topics for those who want to read further.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.
* Comprehensive development environment: Jupyter Notebooks are great, but you need a modern editor too. We will use both.
* Working with Python requiers knowledge of the Command Line. We will use it extensively.

## Bonus points for:
* asking questions during or after class. Many times the correct and the actually helpful answer is "google it" or "ask an AI".   
* pointing out taipos, misstakes, or improuvements in the materyal.  

## Be prepared for continuous: 
* learning: Learning Python means learning new things all the time. 
* updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. First of all you need to learn version control and how to keep up with updates. 
* refactoring: "*If it ain't broke don't fix it mentality*" would still have us living without electricity. 

## Course evaluation. Good news! It's about me, not about you.
* There is a greek saying: "Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις".  
A translation would be: "You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with" or literally "with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn".   
* I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be acheived only if you submit excellent final assignemnts.
* So, please provide constructive feedback and grade me objectively on the effectiveness of the combination of notes and lectures. I would be happy to make the course and each lecture better after each iteration.
* You are kindly asked to grade the lectures, the notes, and the teacher after each section.

## How to ask questions
* Each student is allocated 20 minutes per week for any questions or personal help they may need. Please use all this time and more. This is the highly recommended.
* Read this Guide from Stackoverflow [How to ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
* What to do before asking:  
  1. Google it.  
  2. Ask an AI.  
  3. Try various solutions, document your results.
  4. Formulate your question in a clear and concise way to the teacher, incuding all the steps you have taken.
