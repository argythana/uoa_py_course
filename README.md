# Welcome to the *"Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"* Course.  
This repo contains the lectures' material for the [Business Information Systems](https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/) Postgraduate Program.  

Administrative Documents, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions), announcements, and any internal communication will be done through the e-class of the course.

## Course Philosophy (WIP)
### A lot of good news for you!
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go to the basics in several advanced topics.
* I promise you will be surprised by how much you can learn in a short period of time.
* Mid-course assignments and practice exercises are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit them).
* Two types of practice exercises: "beginners" and "intermediate". Only "intermediate" practice exercises will be given feedback.
* Students grades are secondary here. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy it.
* Each student is allocate 20 minutes per week of my office hours for any questions or help you may need. Please use all this time and more. This is the highly recommended.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "almost mandatory". Learn to use them effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
* No exams, one final assignment, on a different dataset and domain for each student.
* The final assigment topic is generic, the data to work on is chosen by you. 

### A few bad news...
* You can't learn a foreign language in five months. You can't learn to code in five months either.
* Start from zero, go to zero if you don't study and practice a minimum of two hours after each lecture.
* Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times. If you didn't get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am mainly accountable for it.   
But, there is a limit to this. I can't think of a good joke about it yet, just an [anecdotal Sun Tzu story](https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/).   
The moral of the story above does not apply in business nor in education, so I would kindly ask you think about it and assume responsibility for your learning.
* The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one. "The pace of a course is not conditioned by the pace of its slowest student". It goes on without them. 

## About the lectures
* All material is available online, but you cannot learn at your own pace. Attendance is mandatory.   
* If you skip a lecture, you will miss important insights, and you should definitely catch up on your own before the next one.
* Each lecture considers good working knowledge of the previous one as a strict prerequisite.  
* In class, we cover  the basics of each topic and provide extra "mandatory" reading material that we don't have the time to cover in the lecture.
* Please take a note of that: There is always more mandatory reading material that is not covered in the lecture.
* Each next lecture starts with a short recap and question on the mandatory reading material of the previous one.
* On top of the "mandatory" extra material, there is also extra "optional and advanced" material in all topics for those who want to read more.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.
* Real problem examples: Working on real data and problems.
* Work simulation environment: Jupyter Notebooks are great, but you need a modern editor too. We will use both.
* Working with Python requiers knowledge of the command line. We will use it extensively.
* Extra points if you ask questions during or after class. Sometimes the correct answer is "google it" or "ask an AI".   
* Extra points for pointing out taipos, miss-takes, or improuvements in the materyal.  
* Prepare for continuous learning: The course is a crash-course on continuous education.
* Prepare for continuous updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. You need to learn version control first of all and how to keep up with updates.

## Course evaluation. Good news! It's about me, not about you.
* There is a greek saying: "Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις".  
A translation would be: "You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with" or literally "with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn".   
I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be acheived only if you submit excellent final assignemnts.
* So, please provide constructive feedback and grade onjectively on the course and the material. I would be happy to make the lecture better after each iteration.
* You are kindly asked to grade the lecture, the material, and the teacher after each lecture.


## Course Material
### Section 1: Basic python for Everything
See lectures 1 to 5.  
The goal of this section is to learn some of the very basics of python.

### Section 2: Working with Data and Dataframes
See lecture 6.  


### Topic 3: EDA, Static and Interactive Visualisations
See lecture 7.
Feedback for 2025: Add lecture 7b here for data preprocessing (nan, encoding, scaling, incorrect types).
Until now it was covered in extra topics fragmented in a small part in each ML algo lecture.

### Topic 4: Machine Learning Algos
See lectures 8-12.

### Section 5: Deep Learning and AI (NNs, Computer Vision, LLMs)
Lectures 13-16.


### Extra: Python in the workplace by Program graduates.
"Experimental". Extra, optional presentations, started in 2024, scehduled June 2024.  
Example A: Data management and reporting worklow in a betting company.  
Example B: Auditing Cybersecurity Documents with a fine-tuned LLM.  
Example C: Administrative work tasks at a University. (Generate mass word documents, pdfs, and emails).
