# Welcome to the *"Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"* Course.  
This repo contains the lectures' material for the [Business Information Systems](https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/) Postgraduate Program.  

Administrative Documents, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions), announcements, and any internal communication will be done through the e-class of the course.

## Course Philosophy (WIP)
### A lot of good news for you!
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go to the basics in several advanced topics.
* You can't learn a foreign language (or coding) in five months, but you can learn enough to be able to advace on your own. 
* I promise you will be surprised by how much you can learn in a short period of time.
* Mid-course assignments and practice exercises are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit).
* Two types of practice exercises: "beginners" and "intermediate". Only "intermediate" practice exercises will be given feedback.
* Students grades are secondary here. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy it.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "almost mandatory". Learn to use them effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
* No exams, one final assignment, on a different dataset and domain for each student.
* The final assigment topic is generic, the data to work on is chosen by you. 


### A few not so good news...
* You have to study and practice a minimum of two hours after each lecture.
* Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times. If you didn't get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am mainly accountable for it.   
But, there is a limit to this. I can't think of a good joke about it yet, just an [anecdotal Sun Tzu story](https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/).   
The moral of the story above does not apply in business nor in education, so I would kindly ask you to assume responsibility for your learning. 
* All material is available online, but you cannot learn at your own pace. Attendance is mandatory.


## About the lectures
* The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one.
* If you skip a lecture, you will miss important insights, and you should definitely catch up before the next one.
* Each lecture considers good working knowledge of the previous lecture as a necessary prerequisite.  
* During class we cover the basics of each topic and provide extra "mandatory" reading material that we don't have the time to cover in the lecture.
* Please take a note of that: There is always more mandatory reading material that is not covered in the lecture.
* Each next lecture starts with a short recap and some questions about the previous lecture material.
* Besides the "mandatory" extra material, there is also extra "optional and advanced" material in all topics for those who want to read more.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.
* Real-world examples: Working on real-world data and problems.
* Comprehensive development environment: Jupyter Notebooks are great, but you need a modern editor too. We will use both.
* Working with Python requiers knowledge of the Command Line. We will use it extensively.
 

## Bonus points
* Bonus points if you ask questions during or after class. Many times the correct and the actually helpful answer is "google it" or "ask an AI".   
* Bonus points for pointing out taipos, misstakes, or improuvements in the materyal.  
* Prepare for continuous learning: Learning Python means learning new things all the time. 
* Prepare for continuous updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. First of all you need to learn version control and how to keep up with "constant updates". What does constant updates even mean? 


## Course evaluation. Good news! It's about me, not about you.
* There is a greek saying: "Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις".  
A translation would be: "You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with" or literally "with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn".   
* I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be acheived only if you submit excellent final assignemnts.
* So, please provide constructive feedback and grade onjectively on the course and the material. I would be happy to make the lecture better after each iteration.
* You are kindly asked to grade the lectures, the material, and the teacher after each section.


## How to ask questions
* Each student is allocated 20 minutes per week for any questions or personal help they may need. Please use all this time and more. This is the highly recommended.
* Read this Guide from Stackoverflow [How to ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
* What to do before asking:  
  1. Google it.  
  2. Ask an AI.  
  3. Try various solutions, document your results.
  4. Formulate your question in a clear and concise way to the teacher, incuding all the steps you have taken.


## Course Material: (Under refactoring, given the feedback from the class of 2024).
### Section 1: Basic python for Data Science
See lectures 1 to 5.  
The goal of this section is to learn some of the very basics of python.
Focus on how the basic concepts are used in data science, machine learning, and AI.


### Section 2: Working with Data and Dataframes
See lecture 6.  
Add in lecture 6: Feedback from class of 2024:  
Discuss more about changes in dataframes, drop columns, add columns, mutable, not mutable, best practices, etc.


### Topic 3: EDA, Static and Interactive Visualisations
See lecture 7.
Feedback from class of 2024: Add lecture 8 here for data preprocessing (nan, encoding, scaling, incorrect types).
Until now, such topics are covered as complementary material, scattered and fragmented in small parts in each ML algo lecture.

### Topic 4: Machine Learning Algos
See lectures 8-12. To be refactored as 9 to 13.
9: Regession, Linear, Logistic
10: Clustering, K-means.
11: Classification, All Algos in one lecture.
12 (new): Ensemble methods, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.

### Section 5: Deep Learning and AI (NNs, Computer Vision, LLMs)
Lectures 13-16. Requires a lot of refactoring and thought.
Suggestions from class of 2024:
13: Neural Networks, Keras, TensorFlow, LSTMs
14: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Image Processing
15: PYtorch Locally
16: PYtorch on the cloud, Google Colab, Kaggle, etc.


### Extra: Python in the workplace by UoA - BIS graduates.
"Experimental". Extra, optional presentations, started in 2024, scheduled for June 2024.  
Example A: Data management and reporting worklow in a betting company.  (Pending)
Example B: Auditing Cybersecurity Documents with a fine-tuned LLM.  (DONE)
Example C: Administrative work tasks at a University. (Generate mass word documents, pdfs, and emails).  (Pending)
