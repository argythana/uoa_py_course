# Welcome to the *Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence* Course of the Business Information Systems Postgraduate Program.
Administrative Documents, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions), announcements, and any internal communication will be done through the e-class of the course.

## Course Philosophy (WIP)
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go to the basics of advanced topics.  
* The course start slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one.
* Cover in class the basics of each topic and provide "mandatory" extra reading material that we don't have time to cover in the lecture.
* Minimum two to three hours after each lecture to study and practice.  
* Each lecture considers good working knowledge of the previous one as a strict prerequisite.
* On top of the "mandatory" extra optional, there is extra "optional, advanced" material in all topics for those who want to go further.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.
* Real problem examples: Working on real data and problems.
* Prepare for continuous learning: The course is a crash-course on continuously learning.
* Prepare for continous updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. You will learn how to control for and keep up with the changes.
* Work simulation environment: Jupyter Notebooks are great, but you need a modern editor too. We will use both.
* Working with Python requiers knowledge of the command line. We will use it extensively.
* Extra points if you ask questions in or after class. Nine out of ten times the reply will be "google it" or "ask an AI". 

## Course eveluation
* Grades are irrelevant here. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy while doing it.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "mandatory". Learn how to use them effectively and avoid their pitfalls.
* No exams, one final assignment, which is different for each student.
* Two types of practice exercises: beginners and intermediate. Both are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit them).
* Only "intermediate" practice exercises will be given feedback.
* The final assigment topic is chosen by the student. The student will be graded on the quality of the work and the presentation of the work.
