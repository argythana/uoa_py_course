# Welcome to the *"Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"* Course.  
This repo contains the lectures' material for the [Business Information Systems](https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/) Postgraduate Program.  

Administrative Documents, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions), announcements, and any internal communication will be done through the e-class of the course.

## Course Philosophy (WIP)
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go to the basics of advanced topics.  
* The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one. "The pace of a course does is not conditioned by the pace of its slowest student".
* We cover in class the basics of each topic and provide "mandatory" extra reading material that we don't have time to cover in the lecture.
* Minimum two to three hours after each lecture to study and practice.  
* Each lecture considers good working knowledge of the previous one as a strict prerequisite. 
* On top of the "mandatory" extra optional, there is extra "optional, advanced" material in all topics for those who want to go further.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.
* Real problem examples: Working on real data and problems.
* Prepare for continuous learning: The course is a crash-course on continuously learning.
* Prepare for continous updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. You will learn how to control for and keep up with the changes.
* Work simulation environment: Jupyter Notebooks are great, but you need a modern editor too. We will use both.
* Working with Python requiers knowledge of the command line. We will use it extensively.
* Extra points if you ask questions in or after class. Nine out of ten times the reply will be "google it" or "ask an AI".   
* Extra point for pointing out typos, mistakes, or improvements in the material.  

## Course eveluation
* There is a greek saying: "Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις".  
A translation would be: "You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with" or literally "with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn".   
I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be acheived if you submit excellent final assignemnts.   
Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times. If you didn't get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am mainly accountable for it.   
But, there is a limit to this. I can't think of a good joke about it yet, just an [anecdotal Sun Tzu story](https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/).   
The moral of the story above does not apply in business neither in education, so I would kindly ask you think about it and assume responsibility for your learning.  
* Students grades are secondary here. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy while doing it.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "mandatory". Learn how to use them effectively and avoid their pitfalls.
* No exams, one final assignment, which is different for each student.
* Two types of practice exercises: beginners and intermediate. Both are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit them).
* Only "intermediate" practice exercises will be given feedback.
* The final assigment topic is chosen by the student.

### Extra: Python in the workplace by Program graduates.
"Beta" optional presentations, started in 2024, scehduled June 2024.  
Example A: Data management and reporting worklow in a betting company.  
Example B: Auditing Cybersecurity Documents with a fine-tuned LLM.  
Example C: Administrative work tasks at a University. (Generate mass word documents, pdfs, and emails).
