# Welcome to the *"Python for Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"* Course.  
This repo contains the lectures' material for the [Business Information Systems](https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/) Postgraduate Program.  

Administrative, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions, announcements) and any internal communication will be done via the e-class of the course.   

The course has been created, is being maintained and taught by [Thanasis Argyriou, @linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanasis-argyriou-06155a94/).

## Lectures Outline
Please visit the [docs section](https://github.com/argythana/uoa_py_course/tree/main/docs) of the repository. The content gets updated frequently and is refactored every year.


## Course Philosophy (Work In Progress)

### A lot of good news! You will learn a beautiful new language!
* No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.
* Start from zero, go beyond the basics in several advanced topics.
* Think of it as learning a new language. You will be able to read, write, and speak `Python`.  
* You can't learn a foreign language (or coding) in five months, but you can learn enough to advance on your own. 
* You will be surprised by how much you can learn in a short period of time.
* You need to learn, more or less, 30 new concepts in each lecture and a little syntax, notation and grammar rules.
* Also, some idioms, some slang, and some culture and mindset, some memes and some, not funny at all, coding jokes).
* Plus a few super helpful and cool tools (coding assistants, editors, notebooks) and you are ready to go.

### More good news! You don't have to worry about grades.
* Mid-course assignments and practice exercises are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit).
* Two types of practice exercises: "beginners" and "intermediate". Only "intermediate" practice exercises will get feedback.
* Grades are secondary. Don't worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy it.
* Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is "mandatory". Learn to use them effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
* No exams, a [final assignment](https://github.com/argythana/uoa_py_course/tree/main/final_assignment), on a different dataset, domain for each student.
* The final assignment topic is generic, the data and domain to work on is chosen by you. 

### Even more good news! I'm here to help not to judge you. 
* If you didn't get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am also accountable for it.  
* My lectures are so effective that you don't have to study afterward. Just kidding.
* You have to study and practice **only** a minimum of two hours after each lecture.
* All material is available online, and all the lectures are "live".
* The tutor's attendance is mandatory, students' attendance too.  
This allows you to ask questions, get immediate feedback and learn as part of a team.
* Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times.  
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a good programming principle, but not a good teaching one.  
But, there is a limit to this. I can't think of a good joke about it yet, just an [anecdotal Sun Tzu story](https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/).   
The moral of the story above does not apply in education, so I would kindly ask you to assume responsibility. 
* The course is designed to be fun and engaging.   
If you are not having fun, please let me know. I will try to make it better. Nope, just kidding again.

### It gets even better! You get bonus points for:
* Asking questions during or after class. The actually helpful answer is "ask an AI" and DYOR.   
* Pointing out taipos, misstakes, or any kind of improuvements in the materyal.
* Good programming memes are also rewarded.

### Course structure and pace. 
* The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one.
* If you skip a lecture, you miss important insights, and you should definitely catch up before the next one.
* Good understanding of each lecture is a necessary prerequisite for the next one.   
* We cover the basics in each topic during class and there is some necessary reading before the next lecture.
* Please take note of that: Reading the material before the next lecture is absolutely necessary.
* Each lecture starts with a short recap and some questions about the previous one.
* Besides the reading material, there is some extra "optional, advanced" material for those who want to read further.
* Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.

### Course add-ons
* Integrated development environment: Interactive Python Notebooks are great, but we need a modern editor too.
* Working with Python requires working knowledge of the Command Line. We use it extensively.
* Using Git and GitHub is recommended but all material is uploaded on e-class as well.

### Be prepared for continuous: 
* Learning: Learning Python means learning new things all the time. 
* Updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. First you need to learn version control and how to keep up with updates. 
* Refactoring: The "*if it ain't broke don't fix it*" mentality is true in very limited cases. We would still live in caves. 
* As a matter of fact, my "job" is to teach you how be able to continue learning and advancing on your own.
* The "teach a man to fish" philosophy is so outdated. You need to learn how to build a fishing boat. Kidding.  
   **You need to learn how to learn.**
 

### Course evaluation. Good news! It's also about me, not just about you.
* There is a Greek saying: "Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις".    
A translation would be:    
"You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with" or literally:  
"with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn".  
* I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be achieved if you submit excellent final assignments.
* I appreciate your help to make the course and each lecture better after each iteration.
* You are kindly asked to provide feedback on the lectures, the notes, and the teacher all the time.

### How to ask questions between lectures:
* Each student is allocated at least 20 minutes per week for any questions or personal help they may need.
* Please use all this time and more. This is highly recommended.
* Read this Guide from Stackoverflow [How to ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
* What to do before asking:  
  1. Ask an AI assistant and always verify the reply.  
  2. Google it, search for similar questions on Stackoverflow.  
  3. Try various solutions, document your results.
  4. Formulate the question in a clear, concise way, including all the steps you have taken.
