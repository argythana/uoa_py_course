## 1) The role of an IDE such as PyCharm or VsCode 
[Integrated Development Editor: PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)     
 
Install PyCharm Professional or VsCode and activate it using your student's email. 
  
Create a new project.     
Open an existing project.      
Checkout the [scientific tools.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html)    
 
Choose specific python interpreter and virtual environment per project.

</span><span class="s1">## 2) Integrating AI code co-pilot in the IDE 
 
SignUp for [Github students pack.](https://education.github.com/pack) 
 
Avtivate the free for students GitHub [AI copilot.](https://copilot.GitHub.com/)   
 
Integrate GitHub [copilot plugin in PyCharm](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot) or Visual Studio.    
 
Provide prompt examples for copilot.   
Demonstrate usage of code completion and code generation.     
Demonstrate documentation generation.    
 
For the whole course we will use Github co-pilot all the time to: 
* Explain what is presented in the lecture notes. 
* Ask questions about what is in the lecture notes. 
* Ask for more examples about each lecture. 
* Ask for more advanced examples about each lectures. 
* Solve the practice exercises. 
* Ask for alternative solutions for the practice exercises. 
* Ask to compare the alternative solutions for the practice exercises.

**IMPORTANT**    
Using an IDE and an integrated AI co-pilot is **MANDATORY** for this course.    
Please make sure your setup is ready before the second lecture. 
 
### Please beware: 
1) Demonstrate AI Hallucinations. 
2) Demonstrate &quot;Outdated&quot; GitHub co-pilot (e.g. pandas `append` ). We will see examples and exercises were Github copilot gets it totally wrong in the pandas lecture. 
3) Explain again the need for &quot;version control&quot; for python and each module (e.g. Numpy 2.0). 
=&gt; Copy paste is an essential skill only if you know what you copy. A lot of replies in stackoverflow are outdated, or suboptimal.
