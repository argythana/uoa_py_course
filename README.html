<p>This repo contains the lectures’ material for the <a href="https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/">Business Information Systems</a> Postgraduate Program.</p>
<p>Administrative, ephemeral issues (schedule, grades, questions, announcements) and any internal communication will be done via the e-class of the course.</p>
<p>The course has been created, is being maintained and taught by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanasis-argyriou-06155a94/">Thanasis Argyriou, @linkedin</a>.<br />

<h2>Course Philosophy (Work In Progress)</h2>
<h3>A lot of good news! You will learn a beautiful new language!</h3>
<ul>
<li>No previous coding experience required at all. Designed for absolute beginners.</li>
<li>Start from zero, go beyond the basics in several advanced topics.</li>
<li>Think of it as learning a new language. You will be able to read, write, and speak <code>Python</code>.</li>
<li>You can’t learn a foreign language (or coding) in five months, but you can learn enough to advance on your own.</li>
<li>You will be surprised by how much you can learn in a short period of time.</li>
<li>You need to learn, more or less, 30 new concepts in each lecture and a little syntax, notation and grammar rules.</li>
<li>Also, some idioms, some slang, and some culture and mindset, some memes and some, not funny at all, coding jokes).</li>
<li>Plus a few super helpful and cool tools (coding assistants, editors, notebooks) and you are ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<h3>More good news! You don’t have to worry about grades.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mid-course assignments and practice exercises are optional and are graded only positively (extra points if you submit).</li>
<li>Two types of practice exercises: “beginners” and “intermediate”. Only “intermediate” practice exercises will get feedback.</li>
<li>Grades are secondary. Don’t worry about it. I mean it. The goal is to learn and enjoy it.</li>
<li>Use of AI assistants and GitHub co-pilot is “mandatory”. Learn to use them effectively and avoid common pitfalls.</li>
<li>No exams, a <a href="https://github.com/argythana/uoa_py_course/tree/main/final_assignment">final assignment</a>, on a different dataset, domain for each student.</li>
<li>The final assignment topic is generic, the data and domain to work on is chosen by you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Even more good news! I’m here to help not to judge you.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you didn’t get it, it means I did not explain it well enough and I am also accountable for it.</li>
<li>My lectures are so effective that you don’t have to study afterward. Just kidding.</li>
<li>You have to study and practice <strong>only</strong> a minimum of two hours after each lecture.</li>
<li>All material is available online, and all the lectures are “live”.</li>
<li>The tutor’s attendance is mandatory, students’ attendance too.<br />
This allows you to ask questions, get immediate feedback and learn as part of a team.</li>
<li>Each topic, if necessary, is explained three times.<br />
Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a good programming principle, but not a good teaching one.<br />
But, there is a limit to this. I can’t think of a good joke about it yet, just an <a href="https://titusng.com/2013/03/04/the-test-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war-on-concubines/">anecdotal Sun Tzu story</a>.<br />
The moral of the story above does not apply in education, so I would kindly ask you to assume responsibility.</li>
<li>The course is designed to be fun and engaging.<br />
If you are not having fun, please let me know. I will try to make it better. Nope, just kidding again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>It gets even better! You get bonus points for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Asking questions during or after class. The actually helpful answer is “ask an AI” and DYOR.</li>
<li>Pointing out taipos, misstakes, or any kind of improuvements in the materyal.</li>
<li>Good programming memes are also rewarded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course structure and pace.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The course starts slowly and accelerates. Each lecture covers a bit more material the previous one.</li>
<li>If you skip a lecture, you miss important insights, and you should definitely catch up before the next one.</li>
<li>Good understanding of each lecture is a necessary prerequisite for the next one.</li>
<li>We cover the basics in each topic during class and there is some necessary reading before the next lecture.</li>
<li>Please take note of that: Reading the material before the next lecture is absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Each lecture starts with a short recap and some questions about the previous one.</li>
<li>Besides the reading material, there is some extra “optional, advanced” material for those who want to read further.</li>
<li>Hands-on learning: Learn by coding a lot, in class and at home.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course add-ons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrated development environment: Interactive Python Notebooks are great, but we need a modern editor too.</li>
<li>Working with Python requires working knowledge of the Command Line. We use it extensively.</li>
<li>Using Git and GitHub is recommended but all material is uploaded on e-class as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Be prepared for continuous:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learning: Learning Python means learning new things all the time.</li>
<li>Updates: Python is a fast-evolving language. First you need to learn version control and how to keep up with updates.</li>
<li>Refactoring: The “<em>if it ain’t broke don’t fix it</em>” mentality is true in very limited cases. We would still live in caves.</li>
<li>As a matter of fact, my “job” is to teach you how be able to continue learning and advancing on your own.</li>
<li>The “teach a man to fish” philosophy is so outdated. You need to learn how to build a fishing boat. Kidding.<br />
<strong>You need to learn how to learn.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Course evaluation. Good news! It’s also about me, not just about you.</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a Greek saying: “Με όποιο δάσκαλο καθίσεις, τέτοια γράμματα θα μάθεις”.<br />
A translation would be:<br />
“You will learn as much as the teacher you sit with” or literally:<br />
“with whomever teacher you sit, such teachings you are going to learn”.</li>
<li>I would be happy to get a good grade. That can be achieved if you submit excellent final assignments.</li>
<li>I appreciate your help to make the course and each lecture better after each iteration.</li>
<li>You are kindly asked to provide feedback on the lectures, the notes, and the teacher all the time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to ask questions between lectures:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each student is allocated at least 20 minutes per week for any questions or personal help they may need.</li>
<li>Please use all this time and more. This is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Read this Guide from Stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How to ask questions</a>.</li>
<li>What to do before asking:
<ol>
<li>Ask an AI assistant and always verify the reply.</li>
<li>Google it, search for similar questions on Stackoverflow.</li>
<li>Try various solutions, document your results.</li>
<li>Formulate the question in a clear, concise way, including all the steps you have taken.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
